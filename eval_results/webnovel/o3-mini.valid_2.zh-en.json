Correspondingly, as the Blood Explosion Technique was employed, Ye Chen’s combat power surged once again, rising to over 80%, nearly equivalent to the boost provided by Burning True Yuan. Moreover, the Taixuan True Yuan infused into the meridians of his right arm was also rendered blood-red by the Blood Explosion Technique. In other words, the moment he used Taixuan True Yuan, Ye Chen’s base strength truly became comparable to that of an early-stage Star Extreme realm expert; coupled with 70% sword intent and the killing move of the Qinglian Sword Technique, he could potentially slay even a mid-stage Star Extreme realm expert.
